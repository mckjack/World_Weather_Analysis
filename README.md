# World Weather Analysis
## Module 6 Challenge
The contents of the challenge can be found in the three folders Vacation_Search, Vacation_Itinerary, Weather_Database. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this work was to create a database of over 2000 cities and the weather patterns they are experiencing. After creating that we were able to find the nearest hotels for each city within a 5000 meter radius and create a map with markers showing each hotel. Lastly, we created an itinerary for a trip over 4 cities and created a travel route between the cities and then located the hotels nearest to each city. This was all shown on a marker map and direction map. We used both the OpenWeather API and GoogleMaps API throughout the duration of this assignment.
